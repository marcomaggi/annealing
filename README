1. Introduction
---------------

Annealing is a C language extension library for GSL, the GNU
Scientific Library,  attempting a redesign  of the simulated
annealing module.

  *NOTE* The  last time the  author bothered to  update this
paragraph he had tested GSL 1.9. 

  *NOTE* The author supports  only the GNU infrastructure on
a Linux+GNU  system: GNU C  Compiler; GNU Make;  GNU command
line utilities like 'rm', 'tar' and 'gzip'; GNU arch.

3. Install
----------

Do this:

    $ cd annealing
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

  Notice that, by default, only the shared library is built,
the static library is not.  To  build it we have to give the
"--enable-static" option to "configure".

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/annealing

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/annealing


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Info format. 


A. Credits
----------

Annealing was written by  Marco Maggi reworking code by Mark
Galassi.

  The  code is a  reworking of  the files  "gsl_siman.h" and
"siman.c"  from  the  GSL  1.9  distribution  (Thu  Feb  22,
2007).  The TSP test  is a  reworking of  "siman_tsp.c". The
documentation  is a reworking  of the  "Simulated Annealing"
node in the GSL's Texinfo source.
