1. Introduction
---------------

Annealing is a C language extension  library for GSL, the GNU Scientific
Library, attempting a redesign of the simulated annealing module.

  *NOTE* The last  time the author bothered to update  this paragraph he
had tested GSL 1.16.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

First install the latest revision of the GNU Scientific Library.  From a
proper  distribution  tarball, we  can  do  this, after  extracting  the
archive:

    $ cd annealing-0.5.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  To build  the code from a  repository checkout, we must  first install
the GNU Autotools.  Then we run the following script from the top source
directory of Annealing:

    $ cd annealing
    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should   now  see   the  executable   "configure"  script   and  the
"Makefile.in" file.  From now on everything  is the same as for building
from a proper release tarball, but we have to run the "configure" script
enabling the maintainer mode:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/annealing

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/annealing


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Info format.

  Notice that under the directory  "examples" there are 2 full projects,
one for the C language and one for the C++ language, showing how to make
use of Annealing.


A. Credits
----------

Annealing  was written  by Marco  Maggi reworking  code by  Mark Galassi
distributed in the GSL.

  The code is a reworking of  the files "gsl_siman.h" and "siman.c" from
the  GSL  1.9 distribution  (Thu  Feb  22, 2007).   The  TSP  test is  a
reworking of  "siman_tsp.c".  The  documentation is  a reworking  of the
"Simulated Annealing" node in the GSL's Texinfo source.
