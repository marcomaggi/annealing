1. Introduction
---------------

C++ Project is an example project for the usage of Annealing
and the GNU Scientific Library; it can be used as a starting
point to use the two packages to do stuff.

  *NOTE* I plainly suck at C++, so the code is poor.

  *NOTE* The  last time the  author bothered to  update this
paragraph he had tested GSL 1.11 and Annealing 0.2. 

  *NOTE* The author supports  only the GNU infrastructure on
a Linux+GNU  system: GNU C  Compiler; GNU Make;  GNU command
line utilities like 'rm', 'tar' and 'gzip'; GNU arch.

3. Usage
--------

Do this:

    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make test

  This package only compiles a set of test programs, it does
not produce things to install.
